# Middlewares

Back-end project developed to exercise **Middleware** concepts in a **Restful API with Nodejs**, that validates a request and returns a response with errors if any of the configured validation rules fail.<br>

It was also built using **Model-View-Controller (MVC) software design pattern** - one of the most popular architectures for applications; and using **ESLint** - tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in Javascript.

## Technologies and tools used:

- Javascript ES6+
- Nodejs
- Express
- Nodemon
- Yarn
- ESLint (Airbnb)
- Insomnia
